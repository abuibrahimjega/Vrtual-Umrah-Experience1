                 **Virtual Umrah Experience Platform**

The Virtual Umrah Experience Platform is an innovative 3D educational application designed to enhance learning and preparation for the Umrah rituals. It combines immersive virtual navigation of holy sites with rich educational content and a community discussion forum.

This project demonstrates proficiency in developing full-featured, multi-user applications that bridge complex data (3D assets, educational content) with interactive user interfaces.

### **Project Overview**

The platform provides an engaging alternative to traditional resources by offering:

* **Immersive 3D Scenes:** Virtual environments for navigating key rituals (Tawaf and Sa’i).
* **Educational Content:** Integrated resources accessible alongside the 3D experience.
* **Community Forum:** A discussion section for user interaction and Q&A.
* **User Management:** Secure sign-up, login, and user session management.

## **My Core Technical Contribution: Application Logic & Scene Management**

As a contributor, my primary responsibility was focused on developing the **core application logic** and ensuring seamless **user interaction** within the 3D environment. This work required advanced understanding of software development principles and multi-component integration.

### **Key Contributions**

1.  **Scene Flow Management:** Designed and implemented the logic for transitioning between the main scenes (e.g., switching between the **Sa'i and Tawaf 3D environments**). This involved managing state to ensure user progress and session continuity.
2.  **User Authentication Integration:** Developed the client-side interaction with the authentication system, ensuring the **"Sign Up"** and **"Login"** processes were functional and integrated with the main application flow.
3.  **Interactive Components:** Programmed the functionality of critical user interface (UI) elements, such as the **Discussions tab** and the **Educational Resources** access points, linking the static front-end elements to their corresponding backend services.
4.  **UI/UX Logic:** Ensured the user flow—from initial login to interaction with the 3D scene and subsequent logout—was intuitive and stable.

### **Technologies Demonstrated**

* **Application Framework:** (Specify the main technology used for the app structure, e.g., Unity/Unreal Engine, or a specific Web framework if web-based)
* **Frontend Logic:** (Specify the programming language used for the app logic, e.g., JavaScript, C# for Unity, etc.)
* **Full-Stack Principles:** Demonstrated the ability to integrate frontend logic with backend services (for authentication and forums).

### **Getting Started**

*(In a real repo, you would include setup steps here, but for the application, this is just for structure.)*

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Follow the setup instructions to run the application.
3.  Access the platform and explore the interactive 3D scenes.# Vrtual-Umrah-Experience1
